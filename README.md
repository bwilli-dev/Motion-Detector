# Intrusion-Detector


A Python Program which allows you to know about the change of every motion occurs and notifies you on suspicion.


### ToDo

[✓] Add Tensorflow Detection <br>
[✓] Spilt out Videos of persons<br>
[✓] Save only detected part with time frame<br>
[✓] Notify user on any intrusion<br>


Feel Free To Add More...

Get The Tensorflow Model At : https://github.com/tensorflow/models/raw/master/research/object_detection/test_ckpt/ssd_inception_v2.pb

## HOW TO RUN

This Program Was Coded For Python 3.x

Install Requirements by

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download The TensorFlow Model From <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/raw/master/research/object_detection/test_ckpt/ssd_inception_v2.pb">here</a>
<br>

Put The TensorFlow Model in the same Directory As the Python File

Now run it

```
python motion_detect.py
```
